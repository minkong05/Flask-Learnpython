        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [January 26, 2025]</p>

        <p>Welcome to LearnPython (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We are pleased to offer you access to our website located at https://learnpython-zabb.onrender.com (the “Website”), which provides Python programming educational services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing, browsing, or using the Website or any of the Services, you (“User” or “you”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please discontinue your use of the Services immediately.</p>

        <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Binding Agreement</h3>
                <p>By using our Website or Services in any manner, you signify your agreement to (a) these Terms and (b) any other legal notices or guidelines posted on the Website. These Terms form a binding legal agreement between you and LearnPython.</p>  
                
            <h3>1.2 Age and Capacity</h3>
                <p>You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (or have valid consent from a parent or legal guardian) to create an account and use our Services. If you are under 18 (or the applicable age of majority), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary permissions from your parent or legal guardian, who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>  

       
        <h2>2. GOVERNING LAW AND APPLICABILITY</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Applicable Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Scotland. Any disputes arising from these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.</p>
            
            <h3>2.2 International and EU Consumer Protection</h3>
                <p>If you are a consumer located in the European Union or other jurisdictions, mandatory consumer protection laws in your country of residence may also apply. These Terms are not intended to exclude or limit any of your mandatory rights as a consumer under such laws.</p>
            
            <h3>2.3 International Users</h3>
                <p>If you access the Services from locations outside Scotland or the European Union, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws. LearnPython does not guarantee the Services' compliance with laws outside the regions it primarily operates in.</p>

        <h2>3. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. Any such changes become effective immediately upon posting on the Website or by providing you with a notice (e.g., via email). Your continued use of the Website or Services after any modifications have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>  


        <h2>4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND SECURITY</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Account Creation</h3>
                <p>To access certain features of the Services, you may be required to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information. Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your account.</p>  

            <h3>4.2 Password Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree not to share, sell, rent, or transfer your account or login details to any third party. Notify us immediately at learnpython1225@gmail.com if you suspect unauthorized use of your account.</p>  

            <h3>4.3 Multiple Accounts</h3>
                <p>You may not create multiple accounts for deceptive or fraudulent purposes. We reserve the right to terminate any account(s) that violate this provision without prior notice.</p>  

       
        <h2>5. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Learning Path</h3>
                <p>We offer a structured Python learning path (Phases 1–6), covering basic to advanced concepts, along with offline learning resources and community features.</p>  

            <h3>5.2 Interactive Code Editor</h3>
                <p>Our Website provides a browser-based code editor that lets you write, run, and debug Python code directly online.</p>  

            <h3>5.3 AI-Powered Assistance and Third-Party Tools</h3>
                <p>We integrate OpenAI’s GPT API for real-time code suggestions and explanations. We also use Docker for sandboxed code execution. By using these features, you acknowledge and agree that (i) code snippets or queries you submit may be processed by these third-party services, (ii) such data is typically not stored by these services long-term, and (iii) additional details can be found in their respective Privacy Policies/Terms (for OpenAI) and Docker’s Privacy Policy (for Docker), as applicable.</p>  

            <h3>5.4 Tasks and Projects</h3>
                <p>We provide practical tasks, assignments, and projects (e.g., a library management system) to enhance your learning experience.</p>  

            <h3>5.5 Community Forum</h3>
                <p>Users can post questions, share knowledge, and collaborate. By participating, you agree to follow our user behavior guidelines (Section 8).</p>  

       
        <h2>6. ONE-TIME PURCHASE POLICY</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Payment Model</h3>
                <p>LearnPython utilizes a one-time purchase model for course access. When you purchase a course or bundle, you gain access to the relevant materials and features for as long as LearnPython continues to make them available. We do not currently offer recurring subscriptions.</p>  

            <h3>6.2 Payment Methods</h3>
                <p>You may be required to provide a valid payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.). By submitting payment information, you authorize LearnPython to charge the applicable fees. You are responsible for keeping your payment information updated.</p>  

            <h3>6.3 No Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>All one-time purchases are final and non-refundable. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as an extended technical outage or force majeure event that prevents you from accessing the purchased materials for a prolonged period, you may contact us at learnpython1225@gmail.com to discuss potential remedies or partial credit.</p>  

            <h3>6.4 Duplicate Purchases or Overlapping Plans</h3>
                <p>6.4.1 Responsibility for Duplicate Purchases
                    Users are solely responsible for ensuring they select the correct plan before completing a purchase. If a user inadvertently purchases the same plan multiple times or purchases overlapping plans (e.g., Standard Tier and Full Access Plan), LearnPython will not process refunds or adjustments.</p>  
                <p>6.4.2 Upgrade Paths
                    If a user purchases a lower-tier plan (e.g., Standard Tier) and later decides to upgrade to a higher-tier plan (e.g., Full Access Plan), they must pay the full price of the higher-tier plan. No discounts, credits, or adjustments will be applied for previously purchased plans.</p>

However, from time to time, scheduled maintenance, system outages, or other disruptions may occur. We disclaim any liability for direct or indirect damages resulting from such interruptions.</p>  

            <h3>7.2 Technical Support</h3>
                <p>If you encounter technical issues, please reach out to us at learnpython1225@gmail.com. We will make reasonable efforts to assist you, but we do not guarantee that all technical problems can be resolved.</p>  

            <h3>7.3 Limited Liability for Downtime</h3>
                <p>While we will endeavor to restore Services in a timely manner, we are not liable for any losses incurred due to downtime or technical failures, except where required by mandatory EU consumer protection laws.</p>
